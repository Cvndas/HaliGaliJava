### Coverage of initial tests

We used jacoco and gradle to do our initial tests. We created a build.gradle file that ensured we're using jacoco and ran tests using the command line ./gradlew clean test jacocoTestReport. To know if the tests worked, we would navigate to the index.html file found in HaliGaliJava/build/reports/tests/test and to see our coverage so far we would navigate to the index.html file found in HaliGaliJava/build/reports/jacoco/test/html.
